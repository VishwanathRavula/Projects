This is a pretty cool Java project I worked on in my CS60 course. It's similar to a mini-Photoshop, where we can select a picture and apply special effects to it. These Java files all go under one project, and you can begin editing your picture by running the Picture class.

The effects included in this photo editor are:
- Grayscale
- Photonegative
- Lighten
- Darken
- Add Red
- Add Green
- Add Blue
- Rotate Image Right
- Luminosity
- Energy
- Show Seam
- Carve
- Carve Many
- Chromakey on Current Point
- Flip Horizontally
- Flip Vertically
- Flip on Forward Slash
- Flip on Backward Slash
- Show Edges
- Blur Image
- Paint Bucket on Current Point
