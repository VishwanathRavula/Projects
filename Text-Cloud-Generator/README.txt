To use the text cloud generator, run the textcloud function in a Python compiler (IDLE recommended).

textcloud takes in two inputs: url and depth.
Recall that the text cloud generator only accepts urls on the Harvey Mudd site.
The depth indicates the number of times to which you will want the function to web crawl. The maximum value for depth is 2.
